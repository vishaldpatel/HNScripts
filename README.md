This is a collect of javascripts that do various useful things to the frontend of Hacker News with the goal of making the website more useful.

Some scripts may be Greesemonkey / Tampermonkey scripts, while others are just some javascript that you'd copy and paste into the browser's JavaScript console.

If you don't know how to do either one of these, then you should probably not make use of these scripts since they may be broken and you might have to fix them (and file a PR ;)).

Please note that I take no responsibility to what happens when you use this code.
